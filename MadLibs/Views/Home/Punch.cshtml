  <h1>Punch's Day Off</h1>
  <p>Where do we begin...</p>
  <p>Punch woke up at 3am this morning because he decided to eat @Model.StoryList["foodnoun"] waaaay to close to bedtime. He
    thought he was being @Model.StoryList["adjective"] but really he was just plain @Model.StoryList["adjective2"].</p>
  <p>By the time the @Model.StoryList["foodnoun"] made its way to Punch's @Model.StoryList["bodypart"], it was too late. Punch
    @Model.StoryList["verbpast"] everywhere.
  </p>
  <p>3am turned into 4:30am as the @Model.StoryList["gerund"] worsened. So Punch decided to @Model.StoryList["verb"] until he
    couldn't @Model.StoryList["verb"] no more.</p>
  <p>Punch's roommate, @Model.StoryList["propernoun"], heard some commotion from the other room. He got up to investigate and when
    he opened the door, he found Punch @Model.StoryList["gerund2"] on the @Model.StoryList["noun3"]. @Model.StoryList["propernoun"] was shocked
    to say the least. This would be the final straw for @Model.StoryList["propernoun"]. The following day Punch would find a letter
    from his roommate kicking him off the lease.</p>
  <p>Punch was @Model.StoryList["pastparticiple"]. He would never recover.</p>
