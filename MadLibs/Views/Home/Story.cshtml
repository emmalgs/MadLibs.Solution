    <h1>Punch's Day Off</h1>
    <p>Where do we begin...</p>
    <p>Punch woke up at 3am this morning because he decided to eat @Model.Noun waaaay to close to bedtime. He thought he was being @Model.Adjective but really he was just plain @Model.Adjective2.</p>
    <p>By the time the @Model.Noun made its way to Punch's @Model.Noun2, it was too late. Punch @Model.VerbPast everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>3am turned into 4:30am as the @Model.Gerund worsened. So Punch decided to @Model.Verb until he couldn't @Model.Verb no more.</p>
    <p>Punch's roommate, @Model.ProperNoun, heard some commotion from the other room. He got up to investigate and when he opened the door, he found Punch @Model.Gerund2 on the @Model.Noun3. @Model.ProperNoun was shocked to say the least. This would be the final straw for @Model.ProperNoun. The following day Punch would find a letter from his roommate kicking him off the lease.</p>
    <p>Punch was @Model.PastParticiple. He would never recover.</p>
