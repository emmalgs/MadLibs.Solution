    <h1>Qwamp's Picnic</h1>
    <p>Here we go again...</p>
    <p>Qwmap was packing a with a bunch of @Model.StoryList[1] @Model.StoryList[0]   @Model.StoryList[2].</p>
    <p>By the time the @Model.StoryList[0] made its way to Punch's @Model.StoryList[3], it was too late. Punch @Model.StoryList[4] everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>3am turned into 4:30am as the @Model.StoryList[5] worsened. So Punch decided to @Model.StoryList[6] until he couldn't @Model.StoryList[6] no more.</p>
    <p>Punch's roommate, @Model.StoryList[7], heard some commotion from the other room. He got up to investigate and when he opened the door, he found Punch @Model.StoryList[8] on the @Model.StoryList[9]. @Model.StoryList[7] was shocked to say the least. This would be the final straw for @Model.StoryList[7]. The following day Punch would find a letter from his roommate kicking him off the lease.</p>
    <p>Punch was @Model.StoryList[10]. He would never recover.</p>
